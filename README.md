## 📊 Dataset

The California housing dataset is sourced from `sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing()` and includes features like:
- Median income
- House age
- Average rooms
- Average bedrooms
- Population
- Households
- Latitude and Longitude

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
